Codes related to the paper Artificial bias typically neglected in comparisons of uncertain atmospheric data. Published in Geophysical Research Letters in September 2016.

Use fig_1_fig_s1.m, fig_s2.m and fig_s3.m to reproduce the corresponding data and figures as in Pitkanen et al., 2016, GRL. You can test the effects described in the article on your own data by using try_with_your_own_data.m. All other scripts and functions are something I find useful in Matlab data analysis and they are called within the figure plotting scripts mentioned above. Use with caution, as only minimal error checking is included.

All codes are licenced under GNU GPL unless otherwise noted.

The scripts in this repository will not be developed any further, however, bug fixes may be carried out if necessary, in which case they will be listed here.

Enjoy
